# Music project

Project in React practicing working with components, using an open Spotfy-API. 

## Tools and techniques used 💪🏼

React components, props, JSX, CSS.

## My process🧠

My work on this project started by having a look at the API, the construction of it and what data I needed from it. Since this was the first project working with React and components, I started to write the full code in one component - App.js, before breaking it down to an additional component. Lastly i worked on the stying using flexbox and adding the icons as vector components.
